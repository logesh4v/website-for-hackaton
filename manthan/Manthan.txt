Step 1: Define the problem
clear, concise, and measurable data must be taken
checking whether Enough data is available in a usable format or not

Step 2: Decide on an approach
Anomaly detection: identifies data points that are not normal.
Regression: gives a real-valued answer and is useful when looking for a number instead of a class or category.
Clustering: answer questions about how data is organized by 
seeking to separate out a data set into intuitive chunks.

Step 3: Collect data
With the problem clearly defined and a suitable approach selected,
it’s time to collect data. All collected data should be organized in a 
log along with collection dates and other helpful metadata.
but "here already data set has been given"

Step 4: Analyze data
The next step after data collection and cleanup is data analysis. 
At this stage, there’s a certain chance that the selected data 
science approach won’t work.
Step 5: Interpret results
After data analysis, it’s finally time to interpret the results. 
The most important thing to consider is whether the original problem has 
been solved
Conclusion of problem for given data set
